Card Selection Script: There are three main aspects of the main player: #Magic, #Strength, and #Weapon. For many checkpoints in the game, a program will play that brings up two cards on the menu,
They have sacrifices and benefits for all three aspects. For example:

For magic, gain a new mana-based attack like a fireball or a sand shift, or add special traits to your current magic.

For strength, either obtain a new move like a kick or a ground smash, or upgrade your original attack with buffs like fire posession, 

For weapon, either obtain a new weapon (choose from broadsword, dagger, blaster, missiles, other weapons) or add buffs to your current weapon. 


The “sacrifice” aspect of this mechanic lies in what you must give up to move forward. For specific areas, you may not be able to hold certain cards or abilities, meaning you must reset or improve.
